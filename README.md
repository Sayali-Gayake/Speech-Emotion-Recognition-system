#  Speech Emotion Recognition for Early Detection of Depression and Mental Health Issues

##  Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and often remains undiagnosed due to the lack of early detection methods. This project aims to develop a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that analyzes speech signals to detect emotional states that may indicate early signs of depression. The system extracts Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from audio samples and uses machine learning models to classify emotions, helping enable AI-based mental health monitoring.

##  Introduction
Human speech carries emotional cues such as sadness, anger, happiness, stress, etc., which reflect a person’s psychological condition. By processing audio signals and classifying emotions, this project attempts to assist in early depression screening. The model is trained on emotional speech datasets and can classify multiple emotion categories. Continuous monitoring of negative emotions can serve as an early indicator of depression.

##  Objectives
- Build a machine learning-based Speech Emotion Recognition system.
- Extract speech features using MFCC and other signal processing techniques.
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models for emotion classification.
- Support early depression detection through emotion analysis.
- Contribute to AI-driven mental health support systems.
